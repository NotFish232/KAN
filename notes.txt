KAN paper used b-splines to represent arbitrary functions
b-splines have the following issues
- c2 continuity might be a downside
- doesnt apply to the full domain (you have to know the grid range at the beginning)
- expensive(ish) formula

try using fourier series instead

idea of catostrophic forgetting is interesting
- test it on MNIST
use official implementation (pykan pypi package) for more sensible results
inventing new architecture does not matter very much in the grand scheme of things
I want to do a bigger programming project though so I need to figure out how these things apply
